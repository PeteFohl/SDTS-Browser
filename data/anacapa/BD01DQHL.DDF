Quadrangles were referenced to one of the following horizontal datums:  the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD 27), NAD 83, Puerto Rico Datum 1940 adjustment, Old Hawaiian Datum, 1963 Guam Datum, or various local datums.  Quadrangles were referenced to one of the following vertical datums:  National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929, the International Great Lakes Datum of 1955, or mean sea level. Datum information is contained in the SDTS External Spatial Reference Module.  The digital data were produced by either scanning or manually digitizing a stable-based copy of the graphic materials.  The scanning process captured the digital data at a scanning resolution of at least 0.001 inches;  the resulting raster data were vectorized and then attributed on an interactive editing station.  Manual digitizing used a digitizing table to capture the digital data at a resolution of at least 0.001 inches;  attribution was performed either as the data was digitized, or on an interactive edit station after the digitizing was completed.  The determination of the DLG production method was based on various criteria, including feature density, feature symbology, and availability of production systems.  Four control points corresponding to the four corners of the quadrangle were used for registration during data collection.  An eight parameter projective transformation was performed on the coordinates used in the data collection and editing systems to register the digital data to the internal coordinates used in the USGS Production System (PROSYS) and a four parameter linear transformation performed from the PROSYS internal coordinates to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) grid coordinates.  These four control points are stored as point objects in the "NP" Point-Node Module and their latitude and longitude are stored in the SDTS AHDR Attribute Primary Module.  The DLG data were checked for position by comparing plots of the digital data to the graphic source.  DLG data classification was checked by comparing plots of the digital data to the graphic source and/or using PROSYS verification software.  The revision status, and category of revision of this digital file (limited update or standard update), is indicated in the SDTS AHDR Attribute Primary Module.  Limited update revision uses monoscopic imagery and limited ancillary source, with no field verification;  standard update revision uses stereoscopic imagery as needed, in addition to monoscopic imagery, and field verification.  Certain attributes and/or entities, e.g. PHOTOREVISED, convey data quality information;  for details refer to the SDTS Data Dictionary Modules.  The DLG outside area is converted to the SDTS Universe Polygon object.  The Universe Polygon can be identified by the object representation code "PW";  the Universe Polygon does not reference any attributes.  Information on the PROSYS program, the attribute standard, and the NDCDB is available from USGS.
