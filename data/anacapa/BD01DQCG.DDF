Features may have been eliminated or generalized on the source graphic, due to scale and legibility constraints.  If the digital data underwent limited update revision, then the content will include only (1) those features that are photoidentifiable on monoscopic source, supplemented with limited ancillary source, and (2) those features that can not be reliably photoidentified but that are not considered particularly prone to change.  If the digital data underwent standard update revision, then the data meets NMD standards for feature content.  For information on collection/inclusion criteria, see NMD Product Standards for DLG and Quadrangle Maps, published as the Technical Instructions.
