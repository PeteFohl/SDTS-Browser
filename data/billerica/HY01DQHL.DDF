Standard update revision uses stereoscopic imagery as needed, in addition to monoscopic imagery, with field verification.  Limited Update  This file has undergone limited update digital revision.  Limited update revision uses a variety of sources, including monoscopic imagery, stereoscopic imagery, or other ancillary image or data sources, with no field verification.  Manual Digitizing from Scanned Paper Map  This Digital Line Graph was digitized from the USGS source quadrangle, by either the National Mapping Division, a cooperator, or a contractor.    The digital data were produced by scanning the paper map.  The scanning process captured the digital data at a scanning resolution of 0.001 inch or less; the resulting raster data were then manually digitized and attributed on an interactive editing station.    Auto Vectorization from Scanned Stable Base  This Digital Line Graph was digitized from the USGS source quadrangle, by either the National Mapping Division, a cooperator, or a contractor.    The digital data were produced by scanning a stable-based copy of the graphic materials. The scanning process captured the digital data at a scanning resolution of 0.001 inch or less;  the resulting raster data were vectorized and then attributed on an interactive editing station.

Manual Digitizing from Screen of Scanned Stable Base  This Digital Line Graph was digitized from the USGS source quadrangle, by either the National Mapping Division, a cooperator, or a contractor.    The digital data were produced by scanning a stable-based copy of the graphic materials. The scanning process captured the digital data at a scanning resolution of 0.001 inch or less; the resulting raster data were then manually digitized and attributed on an interactive editing station.    Manual Digitizing from Table of Stable Base  This Digital Line Graph was digitized from the USGS source quadrangle, by either the National Mapping Division, a cooperator, or a contractor.    The digital data were produced by manually digitizing from a stable-based copy of the graphic material using a digitizing table to capture the digital data at a resolution of  0.001 inch or less; attribution was performed either as the data were digitized or on an interactive edit station after the digitizing was completed.
