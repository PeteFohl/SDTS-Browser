Attribute accuracy was tested by using the Dodge-Romig AOQL sampling plan.  Statistical Sampling (Plot Based)  Attribute accuracy is estimated to be 98.5 percent.    Attribute accuracy was tested by using the Dodge-Romig AOQL sampling plan.  Comparison of Soft Copy Display  with Source  Attribute accuracy is estimated to be 98.5 percent.    Attribute accuracy was tested by comparing the symbolized display of the digital line graph on an interactive computer graphic system.  Selected attributes that could not be visually verified on plots or on screen were interactively queried and verified on screen.  In addition, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) processing software tested the attributes against a master set of valid attributes for the category;  it also checked for selected valid attribute combinations, and for valid attributes relative to topology and dimensionality.  All attribute data conform to the attributes codes current as of the date of digitizing.  Comparison of Hard Copy Plot with Source  Attribute accuracy is estimated to be 98.5 percent.    Attribute accuracy was tested by manual comparison of the source with hard copy plots.   Selected attributes that could not be visually verified on plots or on screen were interactively queried and verified on screen.
