The tests of logical consistency were performed by USGS processing software.  The neatline was generated by connecting the four corners of the digital file, as established during initialization of the digital file.  All data outside the enclosed region were ignored and all data crossing these geographically straight lines were clipped at the neatline.  Data within a specified tolerance of the neatline were snapped to the neatline.  Neatline straightening aligned the digitized edges of the digital data with the generated neatline; that is, with the longitude/latitude lines in geographic coordinates.  All internal areas were tested for closure using USGS software.
